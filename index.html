        <p class="lead">There weren’t as many web fonts to pick from when I started my freelance career in the early 2000s, still I was always overwhelmed by the number of fonts to choose from. With no formal education in design or typography, my choices were uninformed and limited.</p>
        
        <p>It’s kinda funny to look back and realise that it was harder for me to choose fonts when there were fewer to choose from than now. I had moved away from being a freelance graphic designer in the years since then, but I still do branding, web design and graphic design work for my own projects. I acquired enough experience and learned so much about web typography in my career that I naturally came to the conclusion that many designers had reached before me—all you need is 5 fonts.</p>
                
        <h2>Massimo Vignelli’s 5 fonts</h2>
        
        <p>Massimo Vignelli was one of the best visual communicators of our times. His work had a huge impact on the graphic design of the 20th century. He’s one of the designers, if not <em>the designer</em>, who made Helvetica as popular and common as it is (or was).</p>

                <p>In the new computer age, the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones and trash the rest.</p>

        <p>These are the fonts that I’ll try using whenever I start working on something new. If I really can’t make it work, I’ll go and find a new one, like I did <a href="https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2019/10/20/how-to-choose-a-font-for-a-project/" target="_blank">when I worked on the UX Buddy project</a>.</p>
