        <p class="intro">There weren’t as many web fonts to pick from when I started my freelance career in the early 2000s, still I was always overwhelmed by the number of fonts to choose from. With no formal education in design or typography, my choices were uninformed and limited.</p>
      
        <p>It’s kinda funny to look back and realise that it was harder for me to choose fonts when there were fewer to choose from than now. I had moved away from being a freelance graphic designer in the years since then, but I still do branding, web design and graphic design work for my own <span class="highlight">projects</span>. I acquired enough experience and learned so much about web typography in my career that I naturally came to the conclusion that many designers had reached before me—all you need is 5 fonts.</p>
      
        <h2>Massimo Vignelli’s 5 fonts</h2>
      
        <p>Massimo Vignelli was one of the best visual communicators of our times. His work had a huge impact on the graphic design of the 20th century. He’s one of the designers, if not the designer, who made Helvetica as popular and common as it is (or was).</p>

            <figcaption>An example of how Massimo masterfully used Helvetica in different ways.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      
        <p>He produced vast amounts of graphic design in his incredibly rich career, but only used a few fonts for most of it. In fact, one of his famous quotes is:</p>
      
        <figure class="quote">
            <blockquote>
                <p>In the new computer age, the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones and trash the rest.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <figcaption>— Massimo Vignelli</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>So what were his 5 fonts? They’re fonts that we rarely use today (except Futura).</p>

            <figcaption>Massimo Vignelli’s 5 fonts which he built his rich career on: Futura, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Bodoni, Century.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Times New Roman and Helvetica fell out of favour with designers soon after the proliferation of web fonts in the early 2000s. They were the two obvious choices as web safe fonts, as well as Arial which is a copy of Helvetica. Designers wanted more options. And as soon as they could start to experiment with different fonts, they never looked back to the tried and tested heavyweights from the past. It’s now completely common for a designer to always pick a different font for each project. But the question here is—do we really need all these fonts? And should we really just forget about the web safe fonts which we often consider as “boring?”</p>
      
        <h2>How to create your own list of 5 fonts</h2>
      
        <p>Here’s a list of types of fonts I think a modern web designer needs to have on their “5 fonts” list:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>A geometric sans serif</li>
          <li>A high quality serif for long text</li>
          <li>A workhorse font</li>
          <li>A web safe font</li>
          <li>A variable font</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you take a closer look, you’ll notice that this list of types of fonts aligns perfectly with my own “5 fonts” list. Gilroy is a geometric sans serif font that I really like because it feels modern (unlike Futura which may look dated in some occasions). Meta is my high quality serif font because it’s really well designed, it works really well for paragraphs and has many OpenType features like ligatures, alternative digit styles and much more.</p>
        
        <p>Roboto is a typical workhorse font family. It comes in many different styles and weights and is very well designed. It consists of a sans serif, a slab serif and a mono style and can be used for anything from long paragraphs to UI labels and code snippets.</p>
        
        <p>Work Sans is a variable sans serif font that I really like. It’s highly legible, even at smaller sizes which makes it great for UI design. The fact that it’s variable means that I can match various weights to get a good balance between font sizes which helps my UI designs look slicker.</p>
        
        <p>And the last is Georgia, an underrated web safe font. It looks quite modern which is fascinating, because it was designed a while ago. It comes with old style figures, often called “lowercase digits.” That makes it great for paragraphs, especially when I need to save a few kilobytes. I have been saying this for a while, web safe fonts don’t suck. They’re completely free as we don’t need to pay to use them and they also don’t add any weight to our websites so they load faster. More on web safe fonts another time.</p>
